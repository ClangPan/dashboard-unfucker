# dashboard-unfucker
Unfucks the twitterification of tumblr's dashboard by reverting it to the old layout as closely as possible

It's a userscript designed for Tampermonkey, but feel free to port it to other JavaScript injection methods as you please.

## Troubleshooting
- The script apparently conflicts with the HTTPS Everywhere extension on Firefox.
- Not tested on fully on chrome, but sources seem to say that it does work as intended.
- If it injects, but ends up wonky or all shoved over to the left side of the page, chances are you just need to do a full reload of the page (ctrl + shift + r).
- If you've updated script versions but it doesn't fix a version-specific bug, it's likely because of browser caching, just do a full reload of the page.

## Known issues and discrepancies
- None ;)
