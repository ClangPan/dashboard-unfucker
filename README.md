# dashboard-unfucker
unfucks the twitterification of tumblr's dashboard

it's a tampermonkey userscript, feel free to port it to other js injection methods as you please.

## troubleshooting
- the script apparently conflicts with HTTPS everywhere on firefox
- not tested on chrome, so good luck
- the issue where it would revert to the new layout when switching between the dashboard/blog/activity/etc pages is now fixed as of version 1.3
- if it injects, but ends up wonky, chances are you just need to do a full reload of the page (ctrl + shift + r)
